&lt;!-- ### Why Use a Table of Contents?
A table of contents helps readers navigate through longer content, making it easier to find specific sections they're interested in. It's especially useful for:
- Tutorial-style posts
- Documentation
- Long-form articles
- Research papers
## First Main Section
This is the first main section of our article. The TOC will show this as a top-level item.
### A Subsection
This is a subsection under the first main section. The TOC will show this indented under its parent section.
#### Even Deeper
This is a third-level heading. The TOC will show this with additional indentation, creating a clear hierarchy.
### Another Subsection
Here's another subsection to demonstrate how multiple items at the same level appear in the TOC.
## Second Main Section
This is the second main section of our article. Having multiple top-level sections helps demonstrate the structure in the TOC.
### Code Examples
The TOC also works well with code blocks and other content types:
```python
def hello_world():
print("Hello, world!")
hello_world()
```
### Images and Media
You can include images and other media in your content, and the TOC will still provide easy navigation.
## Third Main Section
This section demonstrates how the TOC handles longer content that requires scrolling.
### Scrolling Behavior
As you scroll down the page, notice how the TOC stays visible, allowing you to jump to any section at any time.
### Highlighting
Depending on the theme configuration, the current section might be highlighted in the TOC as you scroll through the content.
## Customization Options
The TOC in PaperModX can be customized in several ways:
### Position
You can position the TOC on the left or right side of the content.
### Default State
You can configure whether the TOC is open or closed by default.
### Per-Page Control
You can enable or disable the TOC on a per-page basis using frontmatter.
## Conclusion
The floating Table of Contents is a powerful feature that enhances the readability and usability of your content. It's especially valuable for longer, structured articles where readers might want to jump between sections.
### Next Steps
Now that you've seen how the TOC works, you can start using it in your own content to improve navigation and user experience.
