# Thinking of formal systems as simulators

A formal system is a set of symbols and rules that we use to derive theorems. For example, the imaginary number system is a well-known formal system, with one of its most prominent symbols being ‘i’. Another well-known example is the symbol F commonly used to represent force in Newtonian mechanics. 

We often rely on the abstractions formal systems offer as frameworks for reasoning. Any formal system consists of a rule-book with symbols, axioms, and theorems derived from the axioms. Rather than treating these systems like static-rule books for abstraction, I propose that it is useful to take a step back and think of a formal system as a simulator, a tool we use to simulate environments, in order to conceptualize what it means for us to need to shift from one formal system to another. 

Let us consider a situation where we want to find the force exerted on a cement block by a trolley. One way is to use CAD software that can simulate Newtonian mechanics to compute the resultant force. Another way would be to take the help of an abstraction, like a free body diagram (FBD) with arrows on it. In this case I’m simulating a real-world concept—say, an object being pushed. The FBD, with my interpretation of its arrows and numbers, helps determine the resultant force. If a formal system is a symbol manipulator that helps represent and model a complex concept, then it can act like a simulator for some concept you have in mind. A characteristic of both these simulators is that they help externalize concepts as a concrete set of symbols and rules – a block of wood being pushed versus a FBD of the block or a computer-simulated model. 

This implies that we cannot blame a formal system for being inexpressive when it was set up to simulate something else. If I have a new concept I want to express, I need to find a formal system that has the ability to represent the ideas or phenomena I want it to. I will need to survey all available formal systems, assign meanings to the symbols and axioms, and see if the implications of the derived theorems really do express my concept. But since this sounds exhausting, we tend to create a formal system from scratch with the concept we want to express at the back of our minds. 

If I built a simulator to use certain symbols that meet some criteria (axioms), the only way for the simulation to fail to express a concept is if the criteria themselves are incapable of expressing it. Similarly, the formal system was created to express my concept, but that is only my expectation. A formal system doesn’t come with meanings pre-installed. Its symbols and rules are neutral until interpreted. And its expressiveness is constrained by its interpretation. So when it no longer can express a concept, it means our expectations have shifted. 

This is what it means when we say Newtonian mechanics ‘breaks’: it no longer simulates, with its symbols and theorems, the world we want to express. The expressiveness is not a formal system's inherent property, and instead depends on how it was interpreted. Thus, the shift to a new formal system, for example quantum mechanics with its bra-ket notations, can be seen as outgrowing an older system because our expectations have evolved. Like any simulator, a formal system can only express what it was initially expected to, until it no longer can. And it is generally good to outgrow old tools as our vision matures.
