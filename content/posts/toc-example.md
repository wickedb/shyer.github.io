## Introduction

IF YOU CAN SEE THIS THEN I HAVE ATTAINED WORLDYL SUCCESSES 

<!-- ### Why Use a Table of Contents?

A table of contents helps readers navigate through longer content, making it easier to find specific sections they're interested in. It's especially useful for:

- Tutorial-style posts
- Documentation
- Long-form articles
- Research papers

## First Main Section

This is the first main section of our article. The TOC will show this as a top-level item.

### A Subsection

This is a subsection under the first main section. The TOC will show this indented under its parent section.

#### Even Deeper

This is a third-level heading. The TOC will show this with additional indentation, creating a clear hierarchy.

### Another Subsection

Here's another subsection to demonstrate how multiple items at the same level appear in the TOC.

## Second Main Section

This is the second main section of our article. Having multiple top-level sections helps demonstrate the structure in the TOC.

### Code Examples

The TOC also works well with code blocks and other content types:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
    
hello_world()
```

### Images and Media

You can include images and other media in your content, and the TOC will still provide easy navigation.

## Third Main Section

This section demonstrates how the TOC handles longer content that requires scrolling.

### Scrolling Behavior

As you scroll down the page, notice how the TOC stays visible, allowing you to jump to any section at any time.

### Highlighting

Depending on the theme configuration, the current section might be highlighted in the TOC as you scroll through the content.

## Customization Options

The TOC in PaperModX can be customized in several ways:

### Position

You can position the TOC on the left or right side of the content.

### Default State

You can configure whether the TOC is open or closed by default.

### Per-Page Control

You can enable or disable the TOC on a per-page basis using frontmatter.

## Conclusion

The floating Table of Contents is a powerful feature that enhances the readability and usability of your content. It's especially valuable for longer, structured articles where readers might want to jump between sections.

### Next Steps

Now that you've seen how the TOC works, you can start using it in your own content to improve navigation and user experience.
