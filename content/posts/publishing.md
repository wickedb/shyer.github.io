## Business Plan: The Hello.txt Model™

### Step 1: Scalable Duplication
When I'm on my terminal I say `cp hello.txt hello2.txt`, I get two of them. I keep doing this cause I love copying.

### Step 2: Monetizing Distribution
But I wish I could charge people money for receiving hello.txt. Every time I send hello.txt via email, I make money off every forward.  But that's bad cause emails let people download things.

### Step 3: Paywall-Based Retention
What I will do is charge money to just read hello.txt on my own website page. Then when people log off and forget what they read they come back and need to pay me to read it. But I'm too kind — I let them pay at once for a year's worth of coming backs. So they can forget all they want until next year.

### Step 4: Quality Assurance (The Free Labour Model)
But people sometimes say the quality of hello.txt is bad, so I ask a very well-educated person to review hello.txt. But I say it's a peer review and tell them everybody does it for each other and that's how we make sure there's no bad hello.txts out there. So they do it for free.

### Step 5: Events & Branding
Then I tell people they can all come see someone make a presentation of hello.txt but they need to pay for that even if the event is online. And then more people will really want to give me their hello.txt. And then more people will think it is prestigious to make sure my hello.txt is correct. And then more people will think they need multiple years of revisits to my website in case they forget hello.txt.

### Step 6: Asset Library & Legacy Positioning
And I have a lot of hello.txts now. That people can read anytime. I heard that older folks like me had to spend money to print things on paper and use huge files to sort them but thank god I have none of those expenses. But I will call myself a publishing house too.

### Call to Action
**Do you have a hello.txt to give me?**
