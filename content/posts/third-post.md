## Hardware Security Challenges

As our devices become more integrated into our lives, hardware security becomes increasingly important. This post explores emerging trends in this field.

### Critical Vulnerabilities

Some areas of concern in modern hardware:

- Side-channel attacks on cryptographic implementations
- Supply chain vulnerabilities in chip manufacturing
- Secure boot and trusted execution environments

### Promising Solutions

The industry is developing innovative approaches to these challenges, including physically unclonable functions (PUFs) and formal verification methods.

I'll be sharing more insights from my research in this area soon!
