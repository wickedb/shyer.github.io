## Welcome to My Website

This is my first post on my new personal website. I'm excited to share my thoughts, projects, and experiences here.

### What to Expect

On this website, you'll find:

- Personal essays and reflections
- Project showcases and portfolio work
- Thoughts on various topics that interest me

### About the Site

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [PaperModX](https://github.com/reorx/hugo-PaperModX) theme. It's designed to be clean, fast, and focused on content.

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
