## Exploring FPGA Development

In this post, I'll share my experiences working with FPGAs and the challenges I've overcome in hardware design projects.

### Key Learnings

Some important lessons from my FPGA journey:

- Understanding timing constraints is crucial
- Simulation before synthesis saves debugging time
- Hardware debugging requires different approaches than software

### Future Directions

I'm excited to explore more complex designs and possibly contribute to open-source FPGA projects in the future.

Stay tuned for more technical posts!
