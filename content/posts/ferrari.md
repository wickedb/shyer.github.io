# The academic who sold his ferrari

It is commonly understood that an individual's relationship with money has a significant impact on their approach to financial matters. A complex or difficult relationship with money may arise from experiences such as witnessing poverty, experiencing arguments over money during childhood, or being interested in science. The consequences of these early scars can manifest in adulthood as gambling, overspending, or entering academia.

The psychology behind an academic's relationship with money needs to be studied carefully but not academically. Many assume the first rule of academia is to 'publish or perish', but they are mistaken. The real first rule of academia is to disregard money entirely, even when fully funded. Any research student that wants to make money needs to be taught this lesson.

These days academics can signal their membership to academia in many ways. The most common signal is quoting Feynman, which is known to invoke godlike genius in the quoter. But in pre-Feynman days, what was the signal academics used? Feynman himself signalled his membership to academia by detailing how he turned down a higher paying job offer. This tradition is well-respected and has stood the test of time. Turning down high paying jobs is a mark of a distinguished academic but this must be done publicly. This must also be mentioned to any junior academic seeking employment as proof that they can "get a job anytime".

These signals are often used to smoke out outsiders. For example, when Naval Ravikant said, "One Einstein is worth a legion of PhD drones," it was clear that he'd never pursued a PhD himself. Anyone with a PhD knows that Einstein has a terrible h-index. The h-index is a trusted metric that measures academic impact. Another example is when Paul Graham said, "If it didn’t suck, they wouldn’t have had to make it prestigious." There was no need for him to be so harsh on academia.

While the disregard for money in academia may have originated as a signal between academics, it may also have Freudian roots. It is well known that academics often have a great relationship with their parents (who may also be academics). The lesser known reason for this rapport is the aforementioned disregard for money. Nothing brings you closer to your parents than needing them to pay your bills. Some might argue, in a true Freudian spirit, that academics love their parents too much to split up the family or the bill.

Interestingly the most complicated money relationship is not between a PI and their own salary, but actually between the PI and their mentee's salary. The PI must ensure the mentee is paid but not paid enough. The scientific hunger (publish or perish) must be kept alive. Other techniques that can be used to keep this hunger alive are requesting thesis updates in quick succession or suggesting that progress is too slow.

The importance of keeping scientific hunger (publish or perish) alive comes to light when writing an academic paper. In any academic publication, the author names are ordered in decreasing order of time spent working and increasing order of pay. To put it simply, we start with the first author and work our way up to the PI. This smooth team-work is disrupted when there are industry collaborators involved. Because industry collaborators don't have scientific hunger (they're too well-paid) they often ask annoying questions like "Why don't we run more tests?" or "Why aren't the results better?". If the mentee did not have enough scientific hunger (publish or perish), the publication would be stalled to get better results with better methods. Thus, we would have no research published if the scientific hunger (publish or perish) of a junior researcher is vanquished.

A wide-spread misconception is that scientific exploration requires wealth and resources. This is entirely untrue. I was going to provide supporting arguments but my PI just asked for more thesis updates so I will leave the rest as ‘future work’.
